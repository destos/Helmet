Ratchet Parts
=============

Currently all these parts are created with Inventor Fusion by autodesk.

Knob
----
Acts on the spring, and is the main user interaction point when ratcheting the restraining band.
Turning this clockwise should tighten down the band, counter-clockwise pinches the spring releasing the ratchet so you can un-tighten the band.

Slide
---------
The restraint bands slide through the sides, the gear on the Spring acts on the gear teeth in the bands pulling them in and out equally on both sides of the body.

Spring
------
Fits in-between the Knob and Main Body, its very important.
